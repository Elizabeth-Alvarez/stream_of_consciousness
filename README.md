=======================

Project using Processing

The theme of this project is the stream of consciousness. 

The purpose of this piece is for the user to have the ability to interact with what is being displayed. This piece provides
several actions such as scaling, rotating, warping, distorting, and skewing. The user is given circles and an image to play
around with. 
 
How it works:
- Mouse must be within the dimensions of the screen provided 
- Initially a circle will be following the mouse at all times 
- The use of clicking on the mouse pad will provide a new image to pop up and replace the circle's action
- Retrieving back to only using mouse will return the user to the circle
